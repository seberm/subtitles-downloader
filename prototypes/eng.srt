159
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,008
She died two weeks ago in the hospital.

160
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,489
They weren't going to tell you,

161
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,530
but I'm telling you
so that you can pray

162
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,728
for her soul to find its way to heaven.

163
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:37,046
Please don't say anything.
If they find out I told you...

164
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,124
I won't say anything. Thank you.

169

Take your belongings with you.
You know the drill.

170
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,000
So you wanna tell us what happened?

171
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,049
Someone liked his shoes.

172
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,646
Funny guy. You think this is a joke?

173
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,326
You know, you guys
are a hell of a crack security squad.

174
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,841
You were right here.
You could have said something.

175
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,004
But you were too busy
sleeping off this contraband, right?

176
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,323
Come into this shelter again

177
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,484

Hey! Watch where you're going, man.

180
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,651
You could get your ass
kicked for that, OK? Huh?

181
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,643
4.55.

182
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,689
If you got no money,
you gotta get out of line.

183
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,763
I got money.

184
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,648
[woman] He doesn't have any money.
Look at him.

185
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,168
Mister, I told you, if you don't
have money, you have to leave, OK?

186
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,368
You gotta get out of line.
People are waiting.

187

- He's crazy, Officer.

191

- Get him out of here, OK?
- All right, come on, let's go.

192
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,122
Hey, you, come on. Let's go.
Out. On the street.

193
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,806
Let's go, funny boy. You wanna be
a clown, go join the circus.

194
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,850
Not in my precinct, you hear me?
I don't wanna see you around here. Hey.

195
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,611
Jesus Christ.

196
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,161
Look what the cat dragged in.

197
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,088
Unbelievable.

198
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,210
- Look at him.
- Look at him?

199
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,243
How about the smell?

200
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,003
Think I'll call the boys.

201
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,243
You miss us, partner?

202
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,884
Welcome back to the force.

- How's your day been, Luke?
- Started lousy. But it's looking up.

210
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,130
Luke Wright, the Big Apple's hardest cop
<i>once</i> upon a time.

211
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,045
You always could take a shot.
But you know what your real talent is?

212
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,771
You're a uniter. I mean, who'd
have thought that us and the Russkies

213
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,922
would ever be on the same page
about anything?

214
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,084
Not me. Nice to see you, rat.

215
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,245
Been wanting to do this ever since the
day you opened your big fucking mouth!

216
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:18,080
When we heard what Docheski did to you,
I mean, I had to laugh.

217
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,129
I mean, we felt bad for Annie an' all.

218

Them's the breaks.
She knew who she was with.

you were back,

we couldn't believe our fucking ears.

221
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,405
Why would you <i>come</i> back? Why wouldn't
you disappear somewhere far way, huh?

222
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,085
Like the moon.

<i>I missed home.</i>

224
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,604
You were one of us, Luke.
We were a team. We were family.

225
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,843
- Then you threw us under the bus.
- We were kings, you son of a bitch!

226
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,684
Now we're bunch of goddamn serfs.

227

Hey, hey, easy, Benoit, huh?

228
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,721
When you came back,
we figured you wanted to die.

229
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:03,168
We got a pool going on when
you're gonna end it and how, you know,

Come on, take it.

234
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,204
Take a shot. Come on.

235
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,408
Annie's waiting for you.

236
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,643
Question is, do you really think
she wants to see you again?

237
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,006
Hmm?

238
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:26,370
Actually, my real talent
is costing other people money.

239
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,442
You ought to know that, Lesky.

240

You're gonna lose that bet.
Unless you wanna <i>shoot</i> me in the back.

241
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,843
Wouldn't be your first time.

242
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,523
Why don't you just end it?

243
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,089
What are you waiting for?

244
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,163

What are you waiting for?

00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:54,128
For the last time,
give me the numbers.

247

You're a very brave girl, and clever.

248
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,889
But do you know how we knew exactly
what you can do,

249

where you're going to be and when?

250
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,561
- Someone told you.
- That's right.

about your poor mother

when the scum
who took you from home would not.

and our manpower was spread out
tracking terrorist activity,

536

I was the one
who formed the special task force

to deal with the crime
that was filling the gap.

A week later they sent Luke Wright.

Luke's a killer, but he's an honest one.

When he threatened to take
the whole thing to IA,

556
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,246
it took some people with a lot of bronze

- What safe?

633
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,004
The safe the girl gave me
the combination to. That safe.

636
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,962
Something worth $30 million.

637

- To who?
- No idea.

when a man is working alone

and you're as alone as one can be.

644

let us make you nothing.

I guess finding out about that safe gave
you new motivation, eh garbage man?

653

I wouldn't spend my time talking

<i>[Luke] Been a while, Alex.</i>

781
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,361
- How'd you get this number?
- Come on, Alex.

782
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,568
Reach up the mayor's ass, there you are.

He's a better catch
than Annie was anyway.

786

<i>I never understood
how you hooked up with a cow like that.</i>

787
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,251
It was never about her looks.
It was her sense of humour.

788
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:00,528
<i>She's not so funny now, is she?</i>

789
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:03,081
No, she's not. Neither am I.

790
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,605
I have the money, Alex.
I had to kill a lot of people to get it.

791
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:09,125
<i>So listen up.</i>

792
01:13:10,440 --> 01:13:13,569
You haven't made the combination
exchange yet. What's in the other safe?

793
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:16,121
A disc.

794
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:18,760
Names, money trails.

795
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:21,810
<i>When our commanders sent the two of us
to help Danny clean up the city,</i>

796
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:22,961
<i>they attached a price.</i>

797
01:13:23,120 --> 01:13:24,610
In exchange, Danny looked the other way

798
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,604
while the assets seized from every group
deemed a terrorist organisation

799
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:29,569
were funnelled
into their private accounts.

<i>Amazing what people

<i>when they're scared

802
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,164
Amazing how many scumbags
there are out there

803
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,845
waiting to take advantage of it.

<i>- Like you didn't?
- I quit.</i>

Bet that helps all those souls you sent
to meet their maker without due process

806
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:42,886

<i>You thought you could atone

<i>Don't fucking preach at me, Luke.</i>

810
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:51,731
I'm getting paid for services rendered.

811

<i>Right. You sell the disc to the Chinese

Bali, but whatever, right?

814
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:05,564
So, now you know. Now what?

815
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,489
<i>Now you're dealing with me.</i>

816
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,126
- All right, I'm turning around.
- No, you're not.

817
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,806
What are you talking about?
You've got the money.

818
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,090
<i>- The Chinese have nothing I care about.
- No. They have something I do.</i>

820
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,367
Give the girl the combination to your
safe and she will give you our number.

821
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,284
We go to your location, you go to ours.

822
01:14:41,400 --> 01:14:44,609
When we've gotten the <i>disc,</i>
we will explain the code

823

and you'll get the cash.

824
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,603
That's the deal.

825
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:52,324
- Let's hear it.
- It's a very long number.

826
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,881
You'll want to write it down.

827

Thank goodness I brought a pen, huh?

828
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:08,044
You might wanna close your eyes.

829
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:11,611

Thanks for that insight.

841

Your Honour,
Alex Rosen's on your private line.

842
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:05,605
He says that it's urgent.

843
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,969
- [woman] Excuse me, Your Honour.
- Back in five. Don't bother me now.

844
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:11,248
Why didn't he call me on my cellphone?

845
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:14,210
I thought I told you to put
all my calls through to the...

846
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,124
I always told you this place
had lousy security standards.

847
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:23,329
Because nobody's been crazy enough to
come in here and pull a stunt like this.

848
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:27,121
- You got some balls, Luke.
- Yeah, amazing I can even walk.

849
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:28,805
The disc.

850
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:31,161
What, you think I'm stupid enough
to let a gang of Chinese

851
01:16:31,320 --> 01:16:33,641
walk up the front steps and collect it
from me in my living room?

852
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:37,327
- It's in a safe far away from here.
- I don't think you're stupid.

853
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,450
Which is why I don't for a second
believe you gave away the only copy.

854

I'm going to meet Alex.

855

First you give me the disc or I'll put
bullets in places that won't kill you

Yeah, probably.

861

Jesus. Luke, you look like hell.

862
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:07,603
Just alcohol, lack of sunlight,
sleep deprivation.

863

Other than that, I feel great.

864

You know, I was thinking, how many
bodies have we dumped in this place?

<i>You know, I didn't keep count.</i>

They were all assholes, though, right?

867
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:29,601
Let her go, Alex.

868
01:18:31,120 --> 01:18:34,169

He told me about your visit.

869
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:38,604
I have to admit,
even I didn't see that one coming.

870
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:42,324
You had the disc and the money.

872
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,611
What is she to you?

Well, enjoy it while it lasts,

01:18:56,360 --> 01:18:58,931
'cause she's the reason
yours is gonna be a whole lot shorter.

876
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,883
The money, Luke.

877
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,963
In the car.

878
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,205
Or in the bank.

879
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:14,600
Or in a series of lockers
at Grand Central.

880
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:18,731
Or maybe I donated it to charity,
out of the goodness of my heart.

881
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:23,690
You wanna find out where that money is,
you're gonna have to do it the hard way.

882
01:20:18,280 --> 01:20:20,601
You all right, Mei?

01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:02,082
- Excuse me? Pardon me? Anything?
- Walk.

898

Got copies of the disc

a lot of important people
