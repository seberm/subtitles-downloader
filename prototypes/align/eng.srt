1
00:00:01,989 --> 00:00:03,086
Previous on Revolution...

2
00:00:06,792 --> 00:00:08,743
I'm guessing Miles is with your mom.

3
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:10,745
You're gonna go warn him
and I'm coming with you.

4
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:13,113
- Excuse me?
- Your family could use my help.

5
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:15,282
What? What do they want with my mom?

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,568
Rachel, this is Ed Truman, U.S. government.

7
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:19,119
They took out half of Titus's guys.

8
00:00:19,137 --> 00:00:20,755
I'm just glad we got here when we did.

9
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:22,640
I'm sorry, but you come out of nowhere,

10
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,258
you call yourself United States.

11
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,410
I'm curious. I'm a Patriot, Rachel.

12
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:29,647
Can't have you strolling around
telling everybody our secrets.

13
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,451
Aah!

14
00:00:33,485 --> 00:00:35,269
We're working for the Patriots.

15
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:38,239
- So what now?
- Bleed red, white, and blue

16
00:00:38,273 --> 00:00:40,274
until we climb to the top

17
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,326
and kill them all for your mother.

18
00:00:42,377 --> 00:00:44,328
- We'll keep you close.
- What about my son?

19
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,464
Well, we have a very special plan for him,

20
00:00:46,498 --> 00:00:47,465
if you don't have a problem with it.

21
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:49,000
Whatever it takes.

22
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:50,618
Something's happening outside the wall.

23
00:00:50,636 --> 00:00:52,119
I'm gonna find out.

24
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:57,308
- Hold it!
- Don't get cute.

25
00:00:57,342 --> 00:00:59,610
What the hell is happening to me?

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:05,816
- What do we do?
- Well, this is an occupation.

27
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:08,819
Every good occupation
deserves a resistance.

28
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,535
Well...

29
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:27,588
God bless America.

30
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:38,299
Hey, where are you going?

31
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,017
I'm going to find my mom.

32
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:41,052
They might already have her.

33
00:01:41,103 --> 00:01:43,554
Charlie, they have the town.

34
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:47,808
We got to be smart, scope it out first.

35
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:52,780
- Hyah!
- Who the hell is that?

36
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:15,386
Our men from the train yard
had that happen to them...

37
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,005
Sir.

38
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,007
What in the holy hell?

39
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:22,927
No accelerant.

40
00:02:22,978 --> 00:02:26,630
They just lit up like a match.

41
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,737
Send the bodies to horn.

42
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:40,077
So, how well did we bury Ken?

43
00:02:40,112 --> 00:02:42,563
I scrubbed the blood, wiped down the scene.

44
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:45,950
I think I covered it.

45
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,869
What?

46
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:50,204
You're a complicated woman.

47
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:53,057
Yeah.

48
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:05,252
Miles.

49
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:18,482
Were you at a rail road
or something last night?

50
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,954
Well, uh, it's kind of a long story.

51
00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:25,239
You might want to take a seat.

52
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:26,490
You jumped a chain-link fence,

53
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:28,442
and two guys had guns on you,

54
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,277
and then they burst into flame.

55
00:03:41,807 --> 00:03:44,809
How do you know that?

56
00:03:48,396 --> 00:03:51,265
Because I saw it.

57
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,851
Saw it? Aaron, you were nowhere near it.

58
00:03:53,902 --> 00:03:58,305
I saw it... and I'm pretty sure I did it.

59
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,827
What the hell are you talking about?

60
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:04,862
Tell him.

61
00:04:04,896 --> 00:04:07,498
- You think it's the nanotech?
- What else could it be?

62
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:10,117
But it would have to network
images into your head.

63
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:12,169
It would have to obey orders.

64
00:04:12,204 --> 00:04:14,004
They're not designed for
anything close to that.

65
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:16,707
That doesn't change the
fact that it happened.

66
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,960
Hey, everybody...

67
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:24,348
can we... dial back the
crazy just a little bit?

68
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,353
Now what?

69
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:13,564
Who are they?

70
00:05:13,598 --> 00:05:16,350
Those are the Texas Rangers.

71
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:17,718
Which one of you is Truman?

72
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:20,237
I am.

73
00:05:20,272 --> 00:05:22,773
Director Edward Truman
with the U.S. government.

74
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:26,360
U.S. government? Right.

75
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:28,078
Well, I'm John Franklin Fry,

76
00:05:28,113 --> 00:05:31,365
Secretary of the Interior
of the great nation of Texas.

77
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:36,036
And you are an armed force
on our sovereign soil.

78
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,256
You got a reason why I shouldn't
cut you down where you stand?

79
00:05:43,929 --> 00:05:46,580
Gotta love Texas.

80
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:55,689
Put down your weapons!

81
00:05:58,977 --> 00:06:01,278
Last thing we want is a fight.

82
00:06:01,313 --> 00:06:03,814
I'm the one who wrote the
letter that we were here.

83
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,616
Yeah, we got your letter.

84
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:07,451
Politeness doesn't change the facts.

85
00:06:07,485 --> 00:06:10,070
We saved this town from the Andover clan.

86
00:06:10,104 --> 00:06:12,439
I'm just asking for a chance to explain.

87
00:06:19,314 --> 00:06:22,115
You know that guy, Miles?

88
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:26,103
Back when Texas and the Monroe
Republic were squabbling,

89
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:28,422
I sort of tried to kill him.

90
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,475
Oh... good.

91
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,677
Hopefully he's over it by
now 'cause he's our best shot.

92
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:36,931
At what?

93
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:39,850
Starting a war with the Patriots.

94
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:49,716
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

95
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:57,481
I repeat, you can only board the wagon

96
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:59,689
if you have a voucher!

97
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:02,558
You can only board the
wagon if you have a voucher!

98
00:07:05,011 --> 00:07:09,816
Okay! Okay! Everybody! Everybody!

99
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,017
This one is full! This one is full!

100
00:07:12,035 --> 00:07:14,537
There will be more slots available soon!

101
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:18,241
There will be more slots available soon.

102
00:07:21,862 --> 00:07:23,246
Where are they going?

103
00:07:23,297 --> 00:07:25,698
We built a new camp up in Perrysburg.

104
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:28,718
Artesian Wells, closed sewers.

105
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:29,752
It's the hot new ticket in town.

106
00:07:29,803 --> 00:07:33,723
Uh-huh. You sent for me?

107
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:36,092
I've been called up to D.C.,
and my security detail's

108
00:07:36,143 --> 00:07:38,895
a bit undermanned at the
moment, so you're coming with.

109
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:43,399
I'm... glad to have your trust.

110
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:46,936
You don't have my trust.

111
00:07:46,987 --> 00:07:50,439
You have my orders.

112
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:54,861
We leave in an hour.

113
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:58,397
Yes, ma'am.

114
00:07:58,415 --> 00:08:02,919
And so if you could
spend a day or two here,

115
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:06,189
see our intentions are pure?

116
00:08:06,223 --> 00:08:10,793
No offense, but I'd rather
crawl naked through cut glass.

117
00:08:17,434 --> 00:08:20,269
I'm leaving for Austin at first light.

118
00:08:20,304 --> 00:08:22,572
But I'll talk to the General.

119
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:25,141
That's all I can promise.

120
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:27,426
That's all I can ask.

121
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:37,420
Dick.

122
00:08:37,454 --> 00:08:41,123
While they're here, open the gates,

123
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:45,795
stop the patrols.

124
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,748
And whoever got into that
train yard last night,

125
00:08:48,782 --> 00:08:50,917
find them before they talk to Texas.

126
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:53,953
You hear me?

127
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:04,847
Excuse me.

128
00:09:04,898 --> 00:09:07,633
This is from a friend.

129
00:09:18,695 --> 00:09:21,614
Hey, John.

130
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:23,199
You got my message?

131
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,651
Miles?

132
00:09:25,669 --> 00:09:29,272
What the hell are you doing here?

133
00:09:29,306 --> 00:09:31,774
It would help if you
called me "Stu Redman."

134
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,325
Bastard.

135
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:35,494
"Redman."

136
00:09:35,512 --> 00:09:36,996
You tried to kill me.

137
00:09:37,014 --> 00:09:39,382
I could have you executed on the spot.

138
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:42,518
War is hell.

139
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:44,470
But you got bigger problems right now.

140
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:47,173
We both do.

141
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:49,508
And you know it.

142
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:52,862
Let me guess.

143
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,697
They told you they were staying around

144
00:09:54,731 --> 00:09:58,901
just long enough to mop up
what's left of the Andover clan.

145
00:09:58,952 --> 00:10:02,405
They're just good neighbors...

146
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:04,991
helping a town that needs it.

147
00:10:05,025 --> 00:10:09,378
They'll move back north
soon as it's all over.

148
00:10:11,465 --> 00:10:15,501
You know that's complete
and utter crap, right?

149
00:10:15,535 --> 00:10:20,489
Whoever they are, John,
they're not America.

150
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:21,540
They're dangerous.

151
00:10:21,558 --> 00:10:23,059
Look, I get it.

152
00:10:23,093 --> 00:10:24,510
I don't think you do.

153
00:10:24,544 --> 00:10:26,212
They sicced the Andovers on us.

154
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:29,715
They dropped the bombs
on Atlanta and Philly.

155
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,684
They're invading.

156
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:34,770
They're sure as hell not
gonna stop at your doorstep.

157
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:39,725
But Texas is an 800-pound gorilla...

158
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:44,080
in a stetson.

159
00:10:44,114 --> 00:10:47,933
You can stem the tide right here.

160
00:10:47,968 --> 00:10:50,219
You just gotta tell the general
to send everything he's got.

161
00:10:50,253 --> 00:10:54,423
I need proof that they're lying,

162
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:55,908
that they're as bad as you say.

163
00:10:55,926 --> 00:10:58,094
What proof? They're already here.

164
00:10:58,128 --> 00:11:02,048
Miles, we got 70% of our troops

165
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:03,799
already committed to the Southern border.

166
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:05,968
You want me to open a second front

167
00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:08,938
on the say-so of a known war criminal?

168
00:11:11,525 --> 00:11:13,943
Look, I'm not an idiot.

169
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:17,563
I know these "Patriots"
are land-grabbing back east

170
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:20,566
and in the plains nation,
but the boss wants a treaty,

171
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,068
not a war.

172
00:11:22,102 --> 00:11:23,652
Then he's a moron.

173
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:25,905
But he's still my boss,

174
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:27,957
and I've got my orders.

175
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:31,310
I can't go to him without hard proof.

176
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:39,001
Midnight tonight...

177
00:11:39,052 --> 00:11:42,972
Lasky's Mill, up the river.

178
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:47,593
You meet me there, you'll have your proof.

179
00:11:47,627 --> 00:11:51,764
And John, these Patriots?

180
00:11:51,798 --> 00:11:54,984
They got eyes and ears everywhere.

181
00:11:55,018 --> 00:11:56,635
Gotta come alone.

182
00:11:56,653 --> 00:12:01,774
So I should just trust you?

183
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:04,794
Yeah, you should.

184
00:12:28,168 --> 00:12:29,885
Miles.

185
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:35,724
Charlie, hey.

186
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:54,832
Found it on a bounty
hunter up... in the plains.

187
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:57,985
I don't get it. If the
Patriots want Rachel,

188
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:00,087
why haven't they just come and grabbed her?

189
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:02,455
You tell me.

190
00:13:02,474 --> 00:13:06,143
Well, you picked a hell
of a time to come back.

191
00:13:06,177 --> 00:13:07,794
Pretty sure we're in some real trouble.

192
00:13:07,812 --> 00:13:09,279
What? You kidding?

193
00:13:09,314 --> 00:13:10,948
That's why I came back.

194
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:13,984
To save your asses.

195
00:13:14,018 --> 00:13:17,304
Okay.

196
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:24,661
I missed you, kid.

197
00:13:24,696 --> 00:13:27,114
Well, let's go show this to your mom.

198
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:28,481
Hold on.

199
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,000
Come with me first.

200
00:13:30,034 --> 00:13:31,618
I wanna show you something.

201
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:34,037
What? Why?

202
00:13:56,945 --> 00:14:00,564
You've been in town about a week?

203
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:04,184
Yes.

204
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:08,338
And you came in with Rachel Matheson?

205
00:14:08,373 --> 00:14:09,706
How's she doing?

206
00:14:09,741 --> 00:14:13,526
I don't know yet.

207
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:16,046
So you want to be a teacher?

208
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,682
Not really. But, I mean,

209
00:14:18,716 --> 00:14:21,401
I don't know. I did it before.

210
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:24,555
Um, I ran a schoolhouse in
a settlement in Wisconsin.

211
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:27,057
What are your qualifications?

212
00:14:27,091 --> 00:14:32,262
Four degrees. Two doctorates from MIT.

213
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:35,882
You are... insanely qualified.

214
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,537
That's true.

215
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:44,157
Well, uh, thank you... for coming in.

216
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:48,228
The sign said you need a teacher.

217
00:14:48,246 --> 00:14:51,031
I am a teacher.

218
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,851
Still... no, thank you.

219
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:56,436
I'm the only applicant.

220
00:14:56,471 --> 00:14:59,006
Can I be honest?

221
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,975
You smell like liquor. That's a nonstarter.

222
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:03,360
Okay, yes, you're right.

223
00:15:03,394 --> 00:15:05,612
I won't drink... at work.

224
00:15:05,647 --> 00:15:09,482
Just as important...
in the last 20 minutes,

225
00:15:09,501 --> 00:15:10,884
you haven't smiled once.

226
00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:13,654
Frankly, you've got kind of a sad,

227
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,372
unmarried uncle thing going on,

228
00:15:15,423 --> 00:15:18,091
and I think you might scare the kids.

229
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:24,798
Look, you don't know me. I get it.

230
00:15:24,832 --> 00:15:30,053
But I haven't had a lot to
smile about in the last month,

231
00:15:30,104 --> 00:15:36,059
and if I don't do something...

232
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,363
I'm gonna lose it.

233
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:40,731
I mean, not in the front of the kids,

234
00:15:40,782 --> 00:15:41,899
'cause that would be very...

235
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:44,451
I'm very professional.

236
00:15:49,357 --> 00:15:53,877
Please.

237
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,863
I need a job. I need this job.

238
00:16:05,373 --> 00:16:08,442
Do you think you could learn to smile?

239
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,422
You know, she really missed you, Charlie.

240
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,391
Just saying, when you see her again,

241
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:59,759
go easy on her, okay?

242
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:03,063
Yeah, I'll try to play nice. Promise.

243
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:05,765
Okay, so now you need to promise me

244
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:09,769
to not, you know, explode or go crazy.

245
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:12,239
Wait, huh? No.

246
00:17:12,273 --> 00:17:16,410
That's never a good...

247
00:17:16,444 --> 00:17:19,446
Miles.

248
00:17:30,808 --> 00:17:33,460
- What did you do to her?
- Whoa, whoa, nothing.

249
00:17:33,478 --> 00:17:35,512
I know you, you son of a bitch.

250
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:37,431
- What did you do to her?
- I didn't touch her.

251
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:42,185
Hey, hey, I wouldn't let him touch me.

252
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:44,688
I saved her life.

253
00:17:52,664 --> 00:17:55,866
You brought him here?

254
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:03,173
Okay.

255
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,374
Charlie, let's go.

256
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:06,860
- Miles...
- Now!

257
00:18:06,894 --> 00:18:09,513
Hey, I just walked halfway
down the map to help you.

258
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,465
Sorry?

259
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:15,168
That's right. With these U.S. guys.

260
00:18:15,186 --> 00:18:17,688
By the looks of it, you're gonna need it.

261
00:18:21,509 --> 00:18:26,179
Oh, you're here to help me?

262
00:18:26,197 --> 00:18:28,532
I don't want your help, bass.

263
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,983
I should kill you.

264
00:18:30,017 --> 00:18:32,185
That's right.

265
00:18:32,203 --> 00:18:35,355
But you're never quite able
to pull the trigger yourself.

266
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:38,909
Right?

267
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,913
Come on, Miles.

268
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:46,866
Look at yourself, you
handy-capable schmuck.

269
00:18:46,884 --> 00:18:49,052
You can't do this alone. You need me.

270
00:18:51,705 --> 00:18:54,725
You want to help me?

271
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,928
Go away.

272
00:18:57,979 --> 00:19:02,182
They nuked our city, Miles!

273
00:19:02,216 --> 00:19:05,569
They burned it.

274
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,020
They're trying to pin it on me.

275
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:10,440
I want payback.

276
00:19:10,491 --> 00:19:15,579
Best way to get it is
you and me... together.

277
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,614
You know it.

278
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:25,589
I'm asking...

279
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:29,242
I'm asking for a truce.

280
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:42,605
If they're after my mom, why
don't we just grab her and go?

281
00:19:42,962 --> 00:19:45,447
Where?

282
00:19:45,465 --> 00:19:48,917
Plastic sons of bitches are everywhere.

283
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:50,969
This is as good a place
as any to make a stand.

284
00:19:51,004 --> 00:19:52,471
Miles, you're talking about starting a war.

285
00:19:52,505 --> 00:19:54,840
Damn straight. That's smart.

286
00:19:54,874 --> 00:19:58,310
We get the texans to
fight the Patriots for us.

287
00:19:58,345 --> 00:20:00,012
You know, it's kind of like
that thing in Ann Arbor.

288
00:20:00,063 --> 00:20:01,463
What happened in Ann Arbor?

289
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:04,683
Drop it.

290
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:09,438
Okay, sorry.

291
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,607
John Fry is leaving first thing.

292
00:20:11,641 --> 00:20:13,525
I'm supposed to have
proof for him by tonight.

293
00:20:13,576 --> 00:20:15,661
Don't worry. We'll get you some proof.

294
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:31,126
Rachel.

295
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,661
Hey, Cyn. Have you seen Miles?

296
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:34,129
No. Have you seen Aaron?

297
00:20:34,163 --> 00:20:36,799
- He's gone.
- Gone? What do you mean?

298
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,219
I mean he packed and he
left. God knows where.

299
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,854
Okay, uh, let me check in with Miles.

300
00:20:41,888 --> 00:20:44,723
- I'll have to find...
- Rachel.

301
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:46,975
You have to find him, okay?

302
00:20:47,009 --> 00:20:50,696
Aaron told me about your
insane little machines.

303
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,347
Okay?

304
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:54,733
Something is happening to him.

305
00:20:54,784 --> 00:20:56,318
He's seeing things.

306
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:57,903
He's scared, and now he's out there.

307
00:20:57,954 --> 00:20:59,988
Okay, okay.

308
00:21:00,022 --> 00:21:03,158
How far could he have gone? We'll split up.

309
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:06,245
I'll meet back at your
house in three hours.

310
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:07,713
- Okay?
- Okay.

311
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:10,031
It's gonna be okay.

312
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:22,010
I got you something.

313
00:21:22,044 --> 00:21:23,378
What? Why?

314
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:26,398
Just something to help in class.

315
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:40,529
I don't get it.

316
00:21:40,563 --> 00:21:43,949
You needed one.

317
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,618
It's a smile, dumb-ass.

318
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:50,405
That is the stupidest thing

319
00:21:50,423 --> 00:21:52,958
I have seen in a really, really long time.

320
00:21:53,009 --> 00:21:54,927
- Except you're smiling.
- Well, yeah.

321
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:57,880
- Because you're stupid, though.
- Whatever works.

322
00:22:01,518 --> 00:22:03,084
What?

323
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:04,636
- Carl.
- What's funny?

324
00:22:04,687 --> 00:22:08,607
Aaron, this is my husband Carl.

325
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:10,759
Hey.

326
00:22:10,777 --> 00:22:12,895
- You're the new teacher?
- Yeah.

327
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:16,097
And you're funny?

328
00:22:16,115 --> 00:22:18,600
So what's the joke? I like jokes.

329
00:22:18,618 --> 00:22:21,954
It's just... the teeth.

330
00:22:21,988 --> 00:22:24,790
It's stupid.

331
00:22:24,824 --> 00:22:27,793
And why is that funny? How's that a joke?

332
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,467
Is it a private joke, Aaron?

333
00:22:35,502 --> 00:22:37,336
No, Carl.

334
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:41,006
No, of course not.

335
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:45,427
I'm just messing with you.

336
00:22:45,461 --> 00:22:49,348
See? Now that's a joke.

337
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:52,684
Nice meeting you, teach.

338
00:23:02,662 --> 00:23:05,831
Well, it was filled
with prisoners yesterday.

339
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:07,699
Oh, you knew they were
gonna scrub the scene.

340
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,484
What'd you expect?

341
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:11,203
I don't know.

342
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:13,705
A lead, a thread, anything but Jack squat.

343
00:23:13,756 --> 00:23:15,707
Buck up, pal.

344
00:23:15,758 --> 00:23:18,176
We'll get Fry his proof.

345
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:24,516
- What is that?
- What?

346
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:26,969
You're practically skipping.

347
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:28,020
You having fun?

348
00:23:28,054 --> 00:23:30,839
What?

349
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:35,394
Do you think I want to be here with you?

350
00:23:35,445 --> 00:23:37,863
Don't flatter yourself.

351
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:40,315
Okay.

352
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:43,018
Let's be clear.

353
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:45,237
Maybe you are useful,

354
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:47,689
but this is not butch and Sundance.

355
00:23:47,707 --> 00:23:50,358
You're nothing but a dark pit

356
00:23:50,376 --> 00:23:52,828
that I spent too many years
trying to crawl out of.

357
00:23:52,862 --> 00:23:56,114
Last thing I'm gonna let
you do is pull me back in.

358
00:23:58,134 --> 00:23:59,751
Uh-huh.

359
00:23:59,802 --> 00:24:03,555
It's not much, but I
found some wagon treads.

360
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,891
Well, it's better than nothing.

361
00:24:05,925 --> 00:24:08,977
See where they lead.

362
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:15,851
That son of a bitch again.

363
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:18,437
He's like a bad penny.

364
00:24:46,415 --> 00:24:49,084
Afternoon.

365
00:24:49,102 --> 00:24:51,103
Hi there.

366
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:57,759
You coming out of the Savannah camp?

367
00:24:57,777 --> 00:24:59,945
We are. You en route?

368
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:01,480
Yes, ma'am.

369
00:25:01,531 --> 00:25:04,983
Secretary Allenford, Acting Command.

370
00:25:05,034 --> 00:25:07,953
I know.

371
00:25:07,987 --> 00:25:10,271
- I was sent to meet you.
- Excuse me?

372
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:45,478
What are you doing?

373
00:25:45,513 --> 00:25:47,981
How'd you find me?

374
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:50,817
You told me you come
here sometimes to think.

375
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:52,802
- I did?
- Yeah.

376
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,638
This reminds me of the old days

377
00:25:55,656 --> 00:25:57,607
when I had three of these stupid things.

378
00:25:57,641 --> 00:25:59,976
Yeah.

379
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:02,979
Cynthia's worried, and
you need to come home.

380
00:26:02,997 --> 00:26:07,100
Tell her I'm sorry, but I
don't think I'm coming back.

381
00:26:07,134 --> 00:26:09,002
I know you're upset.

382
00:26:09,036 --> 00:26:12,722
Upset?

383
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:14,824
"Upset" doesn't touch it.

384
00:26:14,842 --> 00:26:17,877
Rachel, I killed those guys by thinking it.

385
00:26:17,929 --> 00:26:19,012
You don't know that.

386
00:26:19,046 --> 00:26:20,797
Yeah, I really do.

387
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:23,633
They were gonna shoot Miles...

388
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,469
and then I felt this flash of anger,

389
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:30,673
and then they caught fire.

390
00:26:30,691 --> 00:26:34,060
And I can't any more of this.

391
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:35,478
What if someone else gets hurt?

392
00:26:35,512 --> 00:26:37,747
They won't.

393
00:26:37,782 --> 00:26:41,735
Even if this is possible, and I'm not...

394
00:26:41,786 --> 00:26:46,323
I'm not saying that it is, you saved Miles.

395
00:26:46,357 --> 00:26:49,993
You don't understand.

396
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:55,031
This isn't the first
time this has happened.

397
00:27:09,096 --> 00:27:10,180
What is it?

398
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:12,215
Oh, sorry.

399
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,104
Aaron?

400
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:20,723
The hell you doing? Huh, teach?

401
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:22,075
Nothing. I didn't see anything.

402
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,693
- Were you watching?
- No.

403
00:27:23,727 --> 00:27:26,079
What, are you some kind of pervert?

404
00:27:26,113 --> 00:27:27,697
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, please.

405
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,232
How you get your rocks
off? Huh, is that it?

406
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:31,117
No.

407
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:33,069
Carl, leave him alone.

408
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:36,406
You say one word to
Cynthia, and I'll kill you.

409
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:39,926
- You understand?
- I understand.

410
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,628
Good.

411
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,625
I tried to get them out,

412
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:32,278
but I couldn't.

413
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:36,299
Cynthia thinks... the whole town thinks...

414
00:28:36,317 --> 00:28:38,768
that the lantern started that fire.

415
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:43,022
And I thought so too until now.

416
00:28:43,074 --> 00:28:46,359
Now I know that it was me.

417
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:51,614
Whatever this is, clearly
I can't control it.

418
00:28:51,648 --> 00:28:54,934
What if I do something
like that to Cynthia?

419
00:28:54,969 --> 00:28:57,604
- You won't.
- You don't know that.

420
00:28:57,638 --> 00:29:01,891
I know you.

421
00:29:01,925 --> 00:29:03,926
It would be better for everyone if I left.

422
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:08,231
No. No, no.

423
00:29:08,265 --> 00:29:10,567
Cynthia needs you.

424
00:29:10,601 --> 00:29:12,986
I need you.

425
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,937
We'll figure this out.

426
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:18,441
We'll... I don't know how.

427
00:29:18,459 --> 00:29:21,110
But you...

428
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:22,495
you have to come home.

429
00:29:22,546 --> 00:29:26,332
You, you...

430
00:29:26,383 --> 00:29:29,785
Please.

431
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:41,631
Ow, ow, ow. Easy.

432
00:29:41,665 --> 00:29:43,049
There you.

433
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,301
I think we're okay now.

434
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:48,054
That bullet's gotta come out.

435
00:29:48,105 --> 00:29:50,557
Wait.

436
00:29:50,608 --> 00:29:54,844
This would be a very
bad time not to trust me.

437
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,245
Blouse too.

438
00:30:18,302 --> 00:30:21,588
So, you gonna tell me
what that was back there?

439
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:29,429
I wrote a letter to... to High Command.

440
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,881
A letter? Saying what?

441
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:35,735
Those wagons back in Savannah,

442
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:40,723
they were only letting on
the healthy and the young...

443
00:30:40,741 --> 00:30:45,528
and they weren't going to a new camp.

444
00:30:45,562 --> 00:30:49,699
Then where?

445
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:54,621
A reprogramming center.

446
00:30:54,672 --> 00:31:00,426
Which I assume is as cheery as it sounds.

447
00:31:04,915 --> 00:31:08,251
You can't imagine any place worse.

448
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:09,886
It's behavioral conditioning.

449
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,089
Steady diets of LSD, PCP.

450
00:31:13,107 --> 00:31:16,809
And so I protested.

451
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,897
Apparently this was their answer.

452
00:31:20,931 --> 00:31:23,650
They don't take criticism well.

453
00:31:29,606 --> 00:31:32,292
Well...

454
00:31:32,326 --> 00:31:35,611
looks like I hitched my
star to the wrong wagon.

455
00:31:37,498 --> 00:31:40,083
Good luck, lady.

456
00:31:40,117 --> 00:31:42,919
What? You can't leave me here.

457
00:31:42,953 --> 00:31:44,921
They're trying to kill you.

458
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:48,291
I'm looking to be a
Patriot, not a fugitive.

459
00:31:52,129 --> 00:31:54,297
My apologies.

460
00:31:54,315 --> 00:31:56,316
It's your son.

461
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:03,957
What about him?

462
00:32:03,991 --> 00:32:06,075
They've got him...

463
00:32:06,109 --> 00:32:08,828
at the same reprogramming center.

464
00:32:16,136 --> 00:32:21,424
Where is it?

465
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:25,461
I'll take you there if
you get me out of here.

466
00:32:54,157 --> 00:32:57,176
Well, I hate to break it to you, pal...

467
00:32:57,211 --> 00:33:00,380
but this trail is going nowhere.

468
00:33:25,383 --> 00:33:27,218
Well, I guess it is Butch and Sundance.

469
00:33:27,252 --> 00:33:28,552
Shut up.

470
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:31,722
How many you think? Seven? Eight?

471
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,209
Yeah.

472
00:33:35,244 --> 00:33:37,678
What do we do?

473
00:33:37,713 --> 00:33:40,081
You remember South Bend?

474
00:33:40,115 --> 00:33:41,382
Yeah, that'll work.

475
00:33:41,416 --> 00:33:43,451
What? You guys are just saying cities!

476
00:33:43,502 --> 00:33:46,704
- You sure you're up for this?
- Just worry about yourself.

477
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:48,956
 Heads up.

478
00:33:49,007 --> 00:33:50,708
- Cover us.
- Wait!

479
00:33:50,742 --> 00:33:52,593
- Now.
- What?

480
00:33:52,628 --> 00:33:54,245
Damn it!

481
00:35:23,852 --> 00:35:27,722
- You?
- I owe you for this.

482
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:35,980
- Help me get him up.
- What are you doing?

483
00:35:36,014 --> 00:35:37,815
He worked for Titus.
Works for the Patriots.

484
00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:42,370
We get him to talk, he's our proof.

485
00:35:42,404 --> 00:35:44,071
All right.

486
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:47,124
Guess it all worked out.

487
00:35:57,102 --> 00:36:00,371
You know, Cynthia's gonna
kill you for leaving.

488
00:36:00,389 --> 00:36:04,558
I'm aware.

489
00:36:04,593 --> 00:36:07,561
Aaron?

490
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:09,563
Aaron? Hey! Hey, Aaron!

491
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:11,349
Hey, Aaron?

492
00:36:11,383 --> 00:36:14,068
Aaron, can you hear me?

493
00:36:14,102 --> 00:36:15,653
Aaron?

494
00:36:16,988 --> 00:36:20,274
Aaron!

495
00:36:22,727 --> 00:36:26,447
Hey.

496
00:36:26,498 --> 00:36:29,617
I saw something.

497
00:36:29,668 --> 00:36:32,737
What did you see?

498
00:37:07,155 --> 00:37:09,123
What?

499
00:37:09,157 --> 00:37:11,492
Well, you gotta admit,
back there, that was...

500
00:37:11,543 --> 00:37:13,828
that was kind of fun.

501
00:37:13,879 --> 00:37:18,432
Right?

502
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:29,510
What the hell is going on?

503
00:37:29,544 --> 00:37:31,645
- Rachel.
- Oh, God.

504
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,797
All right, listen.

505
00:37:33,815 --> 00:37:35,266
Hold on, Rachel. Hold on. Hold on!

506
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,519
- Rachel, hold on!
- Get out of my way, Miles.

507
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,938
- We don't have time for this.
- Get out of my way.

508
00:37:40,972 --> 00:37:41,989
Fry is gonna be here any minute.

509
00:37:42,023 --> 00:37:43,190
I'm supposed to be alone.

510
00:37:43,241 --> 00:37:44,525
Why are you protecting him?

511
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:48,362
Because he's helping us.

512
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:50,030
Charlie?

513
00:37:50,081 --> 00:37:53,951
And because I brought him.

514
00:37:53,985 --> 00:37:56,203
Perfect.

515
00:37:56,238 --> 00:37:58,655
Thank you, Charlie. That's very helpful.

516
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:02,176
You brought him here?

517
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:05,379
And why would you do that?

518
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,184
Look.

519
00:38:13,939 --> 00:38:17,508
You can shoot each other later.

520
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:19,860
Right now, just get out of sight.

521
00:38:19,895 --> 00:38:22,012
Bass?

522
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,814
Over there.

523
00:38:23,848 --> 00:38:27,535
You three, upstairs.

524
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:32,039
I'm begging you! Just get upstairs, please.

525
00:38:46,054 --> 00:38:47,871
So, Monroe?

526
00:38:47,889 --> 00:38:50,424
That's... that's quite a twist.

527
00:38:50,475 --> 00:38:53,060
Get upstairs!

528
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:02,069
I am so happy to see you.

529
00:39:02,103 --> 00:39:04,772
I mean, in person.

530
00:39:04,823 --> 00:39:07,324
Just... glad you're here.

531
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:19,286
How you been?

532
00:39:19,337 --> 00:39:21,255
I've been better, Charlie.

533
00:39:21,289 --> 00:39:24,208
- Rachel...
- Look, I understand, okay?

534
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:25,709
When I first saw him,
I tried to kill him...

535
00:39:25,743 --> 00:39:30,097
But you didn't because...

536
00:39:30,131 --> 00:39:33,050
he wants to help 'cause he's a Saint.

537
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:35,286
- Would you let me explain?
- And you believed him.

538
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,421
Are you really that stupid?

539
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:42,560
For coming back here, yeah, I think I am.

540
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:46,981
Both of you.

541
00:40:04,299 --> 00:40:06,500
You found it.

542
00:40:06,534 --> 00:40:10,588
It's... bucolic.

543
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:12,789
What do you got?

544
00:40:15,627 --> 00:40:17,177
Back here.

545
00:40:33,228 --> 00:40:35,529
Son of a bitch.

546
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:53,564
Cyanide tooth.

547
00:40:53,598 --> 00:40:55,633
Son of a bitch had a cyanide tooth.

548
00:40:55,667 --> 00:40:59,353
Who the hell are these guys?

549
00:40:59,387 --> 00:41:02,339
- So this was your proof?
- Well, trust me, John.

550
00:41:02,357 --> 00:41:05,392
If he could talk, you'd be blown away.

551
00:41:07,512 --> 00:41:11,014
Well, I don't know what
you want me to do, Miles.

552
00:41:11,032 --> 00:41:14,351
Now, I can go back to Carver

553
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:16,820
and tell him I don't like these Patriots,

554
00:41:16,855 --> 00:41:19,757
but he's just gonna go ahead
and sign the treaty anyway.

555
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:21,858
He's not gonna start a war.

556
00:41:21,876 --> 00:41:24,044
So unless you can come up with...

557
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,261
What are you thinking?

558
00:41:41,312 --> 00:41:43,514
What is wrong with you? What is that?

559
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:47,384
All we gotta do now is
frame the Patriots for this.

560
00:41:47,402 --> 00:41:50,404
And you'll have your war.

561
00:41:50,438 --> 00:41:52,773
Texas is gonna go nuts.

562
00:42:01,733 --> 00:42:04,785
That is what you wanted, isn't it?

563
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:22,826
